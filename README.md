===========
Delphi Collection Library is *discontinued* starting with 09.01.2012. You can reuse parts of this project for whatever particular needs you have. The source code is BSD licensed.

* *Collections* is a package consisting of basic and advanced generic collections for Delphi. This package uses the standard *Generics.Defaults* and *Generics.Collections* units to access the comparer and equality comparer functionality. The collection classes do not inherit the base ones in Generics.Collections.
* *Collections* package is fully documented as XMLDoc in the source code. You can use Help Insight to view function, type and class descriptions directly from the IDE. The library is fully tested using DUnit test cases.
* *Collections* require at least Delphi 2010 to function. Delphi 2009 could in principle work, but the great amount of compiler bugs make it hard to use.
